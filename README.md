It is aimed to explain the OAuth 2.0 authorization framework to the _"busy programmers"_ who need to understand it in no more than 30 minutes. A simple basic example is given in Scala language for the Java Virtual Machine but it can be easily understood by programmers of other languages as well.


## Examples

To run the examples you need the to properly install and configure the following tools:

* [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
* [Java SDK](https://java.com/en/download/) >= 1.8.x
* [SBT](http://www.scala-sbt.org/) >= 0.13.13 and < 1.0.0

Then start the SBT interactive shell passing the following commands

```sh
sbt new angiolep/oauth2-tutorial.g8
cd oauth-2.0-tutorial
sbt run
```
